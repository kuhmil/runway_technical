Waste of time,2022-09-29 11:22:35,1,"I’m only writing this review and will do it to other apps in the future - quit asking me to review. 

The app itself functions ok, but the stupid tiles with pop culture stuff is ridiculous.",0
Location feature,2022-09-29 11:10:08,1,I hate the location feature this little kid tired to treat me by getting my location in Snapchat thanks alot,0
this app needs to get their stuff together,2022-09-29 10:47:19,1,"lovely app for the most part but they love to ban accounts, and they will do so without telling you why. just because people with lots of viewers get reported because their little fans get mad and snapchat doesnt even look into it. not to mention they refuse to give you an actual way to contact them other than through the support link on their website which is a bit absurd. i have problems id like to address and they dont even wanna hear about it.",0
Snapchat,2022-09-29 10:26:53,5,Snapchat is just overall amazing. It’s the best app I’ve ever used. I love it! Keep up the good work..,0
Streak,2022-09-29 08:16:58,2,Dear developer could you please create a feature that we can block or prevent streaks from those who we don’t want to send us streaks and bother us😑🥺,0
Mass Delete friends,2022-09-29 06:26:52,5,"I love the app but I would suggest snap to add a mass delete friends option because I have way too many people that I don’t talk to and some are just bots, I would suggest Snapchat to do something like that",0
sending snaps!,2022-09-29 06:18:50,5,I use Snapchat all the time it’s probably the app I use most on my phone and overall it’s a great app!! And if you have Snapchat you probably know what streaks are (sending a snap to keep a snap streak going with friends). But it would really help if you could click more friends at once like maybe if there was a “select all” button I’m not sure but it would really help!!,0

They requested a review,2022-09-28 21:45:27,4,"Honestly speaking, I really like Sanp. I’ve had less than five snaps because I wanted the filters. It took me about 5yrs to use a filter, then I loved snap chat. The one thing that doesn’t make happy is the fact that other ppls chat chat will have different / fun filters and they don’t appear on mind. I’m not talking about like going to a new place and finding there. Just different every day filters I’d like to see on mine & my app is updated…according to Apple. Other they that., it’s all to the good 🤩",0

Disappointed,2022-09-28 18:51:09,1,"I’ve had and loved Snapchat for nearly 6 years now. Until a few days ago when my account was permanently disabled with no further explanation. I had tried reaching out to their support staff multiple times to see why this had happened with no response. Now after trying on and off for a few days, the app will not allow me to make a new account either. I have lost all of my photos and memories from over the years with the loss of my account, and now will DEFINITELY not be using/ trusting this site. Disappointed to say the least",0
I don’t like this app,2022-09-28 18:49:13,1,I get cyber bullied for being 4’7 at 15 and my “friends” say mean things behind my back :( not only that it has lots of bugs,1

Permanent Device Ban,2022-09-28 18:22:09,1,"Having an account taken down, okay, but banning the person from using Snapchat unless they pay for a whole new phone is stupid. Especially when the account gets banned by apparent mistake with no warning.",0
Way too many ads on Snapchat stories,2022-09-28 18:06:42,3,Seriously I get an ad like every 30 seconds bruh. Chill out wit it,0

Glitching a lot.,2022-09-28 17:58:41,3,"I wake up from notifications from friends saying they sent a Snapchat but when I open my snap the message it’s not there, they didn’t even send anything. It notifies me when one of my friends post on their snap when I clearly have those alerts off. At this point I only have the app because of my many pics in memories.",0
