Disappointed,jade fujii,2022-09-28T11:51:09-07:00,12.01.1.24,1,"I’ve had and loved Snapchat for nearly 6 years now. Until a few days ago when my account was permanently disabled with no further explanation. I had tried reaching out to their support staff multiple times to see why this had happened with no response. Now after trying on and off for a few days, the app will not allow me to make a new account either. I have lost all of my photos and memories from over the years with the loss of my account, and now will DEFINITELY not be using/ trusting this site. Disappointed to say the least",0

Permanent Device Ban,Aidon Farmer,2022-09-28T11:22:09-07:00,12.01.1.24,1,"Having an account taken down, okay, but banning the person from using Snapchat unless they pay for a whole new phone is stupid. Especially when the account gets banned by apparent mistake with no warning.",0
Way too many ads on Snapchat stories,Chumbersnap,2022-09-28T11:06:42-07:00,12.01.1.24,3,Seriously I get an ad like every 30 seconds bruh. Chill out wit it,0
Snapchat is the best,SSJBJay,2022-09-28T11:06:30-07:00,12.01.1.24,5,Snap chat is the best bc I can call text all my friends and I don’t have to wait for my phototz to go through its instant I love Snapchat❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
Glitching a lot.,aren andana,2022-09-28T10:58:41-07:00,12.01.1.24,3,"I wake up from notifications from friends saying they sent a Snapchat but when I open my snap the message it’s not there, they didn’t even send anything. It notifies me when one of my friends post on their snap when I clearly have those alerts off. At this point I only have the app because of my many pics in memories.",0
Locked/Deactivated,ShaneSaw1017,2022-09-28T10:26:01-07:00,12.01.1.24,1,"On 9/25 I woke up to my main account temporarily locked and my second account deactivated, both without warning. I trouble shorted both issues, sent emails to Snapchat, got the generic automated replies, and still am not able to sign into either account. Worse, I’m not able to create a new account because of a “connection” issue. I have been able to sign in about once a day and then get locked out within a minute. And I’ve attempted to deactivate my other account but that does nothing to fix the problem.
After reading through recent reviews, I see I’m not the only one around that time that began experiencing these same problem. 
It would be great if Snapchat could address them with more than an auto reply email and no fixes.",0

Messaging feature,Bamoki,2022-09-28T02:44:38-07:00,12.01.1.24,5,"so far the app looks perfect, but it will be better if you add a feature that lets users to mute message notifications from everyone except selected friends, similar to the feature available in location where you can share location with only selected friends.",0
